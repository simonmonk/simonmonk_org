FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays) are configurable logic chips made up of huge numbers of general purpose logic gates. This book teaches you how to use the Verilog Hardware Definition Language to configure that hardware.

The book uses, what were at the time, three of the most common FPGA boards and uses worked examples to show you how to get started with FPGAs for LEDs, switches, sound, video and even PWM motor control. These boards are all now a bit difficult to find.
