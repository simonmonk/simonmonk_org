Now updated with a new chapter on the Pico W, this book will teach you Python programming and some basic electronics without assuming any prior knowledge of either subject.

The book initially focusses on Python programming, building up a Morse Code example using the Raspberry Pi Picoâ€™s built-in LED. Once you have mastered the basics of coding the Pico, the book will introduce electronics, showing you how to use sensors, switches, LEDs, servomotors and displays attached to your Pico or Pico W.

Paperback: 162 pages, ISBN: 978-1-7394874-3-0
