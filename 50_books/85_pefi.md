A Fully-Updated, No-Nonsense Guide to Electronics

![cover](/assets/images/cover_pefi4.jpg)

Advance your electronics knowledge and gain the skills necessary to develop and construct your own functioning gadgets. Written by a pair of experienced engineers and dedicated hobbyists, Practical Electronics for Inventors, Fourth Edition, lays out the essentials and provides step-by-step instructions, schematics, and illustrations. Discover how to select the right components, design and build circuits, use microcontrollers and ICs, work with the latest software tools, and test and tweak your creations. This easy-to-follow book features new instruction on programmable logic, semiconductors, operational amplifiers, voltage regulators, power supplies, digital electronics, and more.

Practical Electronics for Inventors, Fourth Edition, covers:

- Resistors, capacitors, inductors, and transformers
- Diodes, transistors, and integrated circuits
- Optoelectronics, solar cells, and phototransistors
- Sensors, GPS modules, and touch screens
- Op amps, regulators, and power supplies
- Digital electronics, LCD displays, and logic gates
- Microcontrollers and prototyping platforms
- Combinational and sequential programmable logic
- DC motors, RC servos, and stepper motors
- Microphones, audio amps, and speakers
- Modular electronics and prototypes

## Errata
The publisher is aware of the following errata and they will make their way into the print version in the next printing (due around Feb 2018). So your copy may already be corrected. Many thanks to  Andy Shiekh and Johannes Berg for finding these.

First page inside the front cover in the bottom right corner:

* = V, A,W (missing space after the comma)

P2 – Figure 1-1

This diagram is one of Paul’s I don’t have the original, but in the box ‘Output Devices’ ‘Stopper’ should be ‘Stepper’

P33 in the first ‘Answer’ change ‘176 W’ to ‘175.5 W’

P109 – Figure 2.104 – Capacitors in Series

The top capacitor is labelled C1 1µF 50V – change 50V to 63V

P130 near the bottom of the page, reference to “Fig. 1.128” should be “Fig. 2.128”

P314 Precision Wirewound

change ‘high tolerances’ to ‘narrow tolerances’

P333 half way down Fig 3.65

remove the hyphen from ‘tem-perature’

P340 – Supercapacitors

change ‘(from 0.022 to 50 F)’ to ‘(from 0.022 to 3000F)’

P358 – Figure 3.85 in the section ‘Toroidal Inductor’

cross-sectional area

replace OD-ID / 2 with (OD-ID)2        where the two is superscript for squared.

P378 – Notes About Phase 1/3 of the way down.

identical in very way change ‘very’ to ‘every’

P449 – near the bottom of the page

change ‘en-hancement’ to ‘enhancement’

P637 Fig 8.5 ‘output amplier’ should be ‘output amplifier’

P757 last word on the page

change ‘off’ to ‘on’

P953 Fig 16.8

Change “Comparitor” -> “Comparator”

P988 

5th equation down – n not equal to 1 (should be n not equal to -1)

7th equation – put an x before the e on the right hand side of the equation.

last equation – after ‘cos x’ but before the ‘=’ add ‘dx’
