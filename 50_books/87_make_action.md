This book shows you how to connect all sorts of devices to Raspberry Pi and Arduino and to control them. There are also some pretty cool projects along the way, including a dancing puppet, a drinks can crusher and a balloon popper.

Make: Action is a complement to Make: Sensors. It concentrates on how you can control things from your Arduino or Raspberry Pi. Those things you might want to control include different types of motor, heaters and displays.

Make: Action also includes a long and thorough chapter exploring PID control.


## Errata

Page 277 near the bottom the command URL to fetch the Raspberry Pi Adafruit SD1331 code is wrong. The git clone command should be:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_SSD1306.git
```
