I love O’Reilly’s Cookbook series. Unlike traditional electronics textbook, the ‘cookbooks’ allow you to dive straight into a particular ‘recipe’ for a problem you need to solve. If you can’t do this without knowing about some more basic recipe then you will be directed back to that recipe and so on.

My electronics Cookbook is intended as a reference for the Maker or Hobbyist and includes practical recipes for most of you electronics needs.
