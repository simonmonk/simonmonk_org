Whereas there are many books that will teach you a particular programming language, this book sets this core skill in the context of both the software tools people use and the software industry as a whole.
The book does not assume any prior knowledge of coding. Part I of the book aims to teach a basic knowledge of Python (the most popular programming language) as well as other technologies that are typical of real-life development such as databases and web frameworks.

Part II of the book will let you in on all the things that happen in software development teams and what a coder actually does day-to-day. This part of the book provides information about some of the wide variety of jobs available in the software industry, and the different kinds of organization where you might find yourself working.
If you want to learn coding or pursue a career in software, then this book will help you onto that path.

This book is in full color throughout and is available as eBook or paperback.
