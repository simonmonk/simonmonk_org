Build your own secret laboratory with 30 coding and electronic projects!

![cover](/assets/images/cover_mbms.jpg)

The BBC micro:bit is a tiny, cheap, yet surprisingly powerful computer that you can use to build cool things and experiment with code. The 30 simple projects and experiments in this book will show you how to use the micro:bit to build a secret science lab complete with robots, door alarms, lie detectors, and moreâ€”as you learn basic coding and electronics skills.

Here are just some of the projects you'll build:
- "light guitar" you can play just by moving your fingers
- A working lie detector
- A self-watering plant care system
- A two-wheeled robot
- A talking robotic head with moving eyes
- A door alarm made with magnets
